## 📖 Origin and Acknowledgments

searXena was originally born as a research initiative to create an experimental *port* of [SearXNG](https://github.com/searxng/searxng) aimed at running natively on Windows operating systems without the overhead of Docker containers or WSL subsystems involved. 

As development progressed and the need for deeper interactive integrations arose, **searXena evolved to become an iteratively independent software**. Our codebase was rewritten and structured under its own micro-manager architecture (FastAPI), while retaining the spirit of user sovereignty established by the open-source movement.

We formally recognize and honor the original SearXNG project and its community developers for setting the universal standards and theoretical foundation (parsers, evasion, proxy headers) on how a censorship-resistant metasearch engine should operate.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

searXena leverages modern and ultra-lightweight technologies to enable hyper-fluid execution even on secondary local hardware:

- **Backend:** [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/) and [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) (High-performance asynchronous framework).
- **Web Server:** [Uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/) (Native ASGI support).
- **Network Processing:** `httpx` for parallel and asynchronous HTTP/2 requests with ultra-low latency.
- **Frontend / Rendering:** [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/) coupled with Vanilla JavaScript (zero frameworks like React) and Pure CSS3 ensuring instant speed.
- **Structured Scraping:** `lxml` and `BeautifulSoup4` coupled with modular selectors for DOM analysis.

## ✨ Main Features

* 🚀 **Asynchronous Parallel Metasearch:** A single query from you triggers dozens of asynchronous requests to global engines (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, Brave, GitHub, Wikipedia, MDN, NPM, etc.), consolidating them in less than 1 second.
* 🤖 **AI-First Integration:** Native JSON formatting and pre-built Tools schemas, ready to connect your LLM deployment to the internet without overheads or unnecessary HTML scraping.
* 🛡️ **Tracking Prevention:** Acts as an intermediary proxy between you and mega-corporations. Significantly hinders corporate user profiling by acting as an intermediary.
* 📦 **100% Native on Windows:** Zero complex dependencies. Just clone, install the libraries with `pip`, run the main `.py` file, and you have a corporate search engine evading telemetry hosted locally on your system.
* 📱 **Modern and Dynamic UI/UX:** Fluid animations, ultra-refined dark mode ("Space Violet"), responsive interface, and categorically separated into tabs (General, IT/Science, Maps, Videos, Images).
* 🌎 **Consolidated Rich Snippets:** Enriched reading consolidating data from Wikipedia or Wikidata in quick-consumption side boxes ("Infoboxes") in the style of major commercial engines.

## 🥊 Why We Have No Rival on Windows (searXena vs The Rest)

Historically, open-source metasearch engines focused on privacy (like SearXNG or Whoogle) were born and designed **strictly intended for GNU/Linux environments or Cloud deployments**. If a Windows user wanted to run them locally, they had to face an odyssey of technical friction: installing **WSL2** (Windows Subsystem for Linux), dedicating fixed memory resources for virtual machines, configuring **Docker** daemons, dealing with container network configurations (NAT bridging), and wasting gigabytes of storage just to start a search bar.

**searXena completely eliminates all these barriers. We have no rivals in this ecosystem because we are 100% native.**

| Feature | 👾 The "Rivals" (SearXNG / Whoogle) | 👑 searXena |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Windows Architecture** | Forced Virtualization (Docker / WSL2) | **Direct to Kernel** (via native Python) |
| **Memory Consumption** | ~1 GB to 2 GB (Due to VM / Container overhead) | **~30 MB - 60 MB** (Pure Execution) |
| **Startup Time** | Slow (Starts Docker Engine, then boots the stack) | **Instantaneous** (Less than a second) |
| **Installation Experience** | Complex, sysadmin commands oriented to Linux | **Simple** (One-click `.ps1` auto-setup script) |
| **LLM Tool Calling** | External community adapters required | **Native JSON API** built from day one |

Unless you want to rent a VPS in the cloud, searXena is the only logical, viable, and high-performance answer for the demanding Windows user who desires *in-house* data sovereignty.

## 🤖 Artificial Intelligence and Agents

searXena is not just an interface for humans; it is a **search infrastructure optimized for the AI era**. We have designed the engine to serve as real-time "eyes" for your Large Language Models (LLMs).

*   **Internet Exploration for AI:** Provides a clean, structured data stream that allows agents to navigate and research the web without the friction of visual rendering.
*   **Native Tool Calling:** Core-level compatibility with the OpenAI/Anthropic "Functions" standard.
*   **Curated Ranking for RAG:** Results are prioritized to feed *Retrieval-Augmented Generation* systems, filtering out commercial noise and prioritizing substantial technical and encyclopedic information sources.

## 🔒 Transparent Privacy Architecture

searXena priorities that your data **never** ends up in advertising profiles (Google/Meta), assuming a shield role beneath the graphical interface. Even so, the architecture requires certain technical consensuses, reported here transparently:

### Absolute DOM Proxification
When you search any general query (News, IT, Code), searXena masks your identity through the asynchronous backend engine. We systematically modify the `User-Agent`s. Every image URL returned by commercial engines is forcibly passed through our internal `/proxify` system, preventing your IP from leaking directly.

### Maps Module: OSM (OpenStreetMap)
When interacting with the specialized Maps tab, searXena implements slightly more permeable rules to achieve useful interactivity (drag, zoom), preserving commercial anonymity:
* **Clean Geocoding**: The nominal request (e.g., "Search Jalisco") is shielded through the backend core in favor of anonymity. OSM never knows your search words.
* **IP Transparency (The Interactive Iframe)**: For you to experience a functional draggable map within the Maps section, we inject a dynamic `iframe` referencing `openstreetmap.org`. This causes **your browser to make a direct connection to OSM temporarily revealing your public IP** for downloading visual tiles.
* The trade-off: OSM is a [pro-privacy open](https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_Policy) foundation without engines that auction telemetry or cross-tracking cookies, making the native IP exposure benign and justified in exchange for integrating functional cartography.

## 🤖 Native Artificial Intelligence Integration (API)

searXena is not just for human consumption. It is designed from its web base to **act as the research search engine for your own local or cloud-based AI agents (LLMs)**, providing native *Tool Calling* support strictly standardized (OpenAI/Anthropic/Gemini format).

Through the `/api/v1/search` route, your assistant can automate queries and receive answers in **clean, indexed, and structured JSON**, suppressing the HTML, CSS, or the costly visual noise derived from raw scrapers.

* **AI-Ready Endpoints:**
  * `GET /api/v1/tools_schema`: Returns a literal `function_declarations` schema directly injectable into your LLM with all available enabled parameters.
  * `POST /api/v1/search`: Communication webhook that executes the search and returns deep analytical metadata.
* **Anti-Hallucination Smart Ranking:** The heuristic filter processes the returns in favor of the agent; under the "IT" category, it hides advertising sites from the LLM and feeds it directly from StackOverflow, MDN Web Docs, and substantial GitHub repositories.
